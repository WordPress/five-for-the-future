<p>
	This is just rough text-based output to check that it's working in a way that will be friendly for the vizualization that will be added in #38 (and a11y fallbacks, if any are needed).
</p>

<p>
	When that is implemented, the controller can add the data to a JSON array with `date` => `value` entries, or whatever the visualization library wants, rather than looping through it below.
</p>

<?php

/*
Label the h3s w/ full text descriptions instead of slugs. rough ones:
	number of total pledged hours across all companies/teams/etc
	number of people contributing (regardless of how many hours
	number of companies contributing (regardless of how many hours
	# of contributors sponsored for each team

how to visualize teams? maybe a dropdown w/ each team, so not a huge long list of chart for each
